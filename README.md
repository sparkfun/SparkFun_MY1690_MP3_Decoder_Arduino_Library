This library provides full access to the functions of the MY1690 MP3 decoder through a serial connection and a "busy" pin. This library is very simple to use with either a hardware or software serial port. The simple dependencies (HardwareSerial and SoftwareSerial) make it suitable for use on any Arduino-compatible platform.

The MY1690 combines two functions needed to play .mp3 files into one package and adds a simple serial control interface. Normally to play a .mp3 file one would need to choose a decoder IC AND provide a method for storing and selecting the files. The MY1690 removes that complexity by combining an SD card interface and .mp3 decoder. Now in order to play a song all you need to do is save it to an SD card, plug it into the MY1690 breakout, and send a few commands over serial. This allows you to easily integrate sound into any Arduino project.
